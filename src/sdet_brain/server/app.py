"""FastAPI application factory.

`create_app()` builds the app and wires its lifespan: Qdrant + embedder
construction at startup, graceful close on shutdown. Failures during
startup are logged and reported through `/health` rather than crashing
the process - the server stays useful enough to surface its own
problems.
