# SDET Brain

> Persistent RAG for the SDET brand domain. Shared context across Claude
> Desktop, Claude Code, OpenCode, and other MCP clients - so handoff documents

## Why this exists

I write a lot of brand-related material in scattered Markdown files: project
context, voice samples, decision logs, sprint reports. Every new Claude.ai
chat used to start with the same paste-the-context dance.

SDET Brain is a single source of truth that any MCP-aware client can query
through the same set of tools. Embeddings live in Qdrant, sources stay on
disk, and a file watcher keeps the index fresh as I edit.

The four layers map to top-level packages: `server/`, `ingestion/`,
`embeddings/`, and `storage/`. CLI entrypoints live in `cli/`.

## Stack

| Layer | Choice |
| --- | --- |
| Vector store | Qdrant 1.12+ (Docker, self-hosted) |
| Embeddings (primary) | MLX local - `Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B` (1024-dim) |
| Embeddings (fallback) | Google Gemini `text-embedding-004` (768-dim) |
| Server | FastAPI + FastMCP 3.0 (stdio / SSE / streamable HTTP) |
| Ingestion | watchdog file watcher + python-frontmatter + semantic chunker |
| Tooling | uv, mypy --strict, ruff, pytest |

## Quick start

> Prerequisites: macOS or Linux, Python 3.12+, [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/),
> Docker Desktop running.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:darco81/sdet-brain.git
cd sdet-brain

# 1. Install dependencies into a managed venv.
uv sync --extra dev

# 2. Copy env template and fill in any secrets you need.
cp .env.example .env

# 3. Start Qdrant in the background.
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d qdrant

# 4. (Coming in T1-06) Start the REST + MCP server.
uv run sdet-brain-server
```

Until the server task lands, use the smoke test to verify the install:

```bash
uv run pytest -q
```

## Embeddings

Two interchangeable providers expose the same `IEmbedder` contract
(`vector_size`, `model_name`, `embed`, `health_check`):

| Provider | When to use | Vector size | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **MLX** (default) | Apple Silicon dev box | 1024 | Lazy-loads `Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B` on first call. |
| **Gemini** | Cloud / VPS / laptop offline | 768 | Uses `text-embedding-004` via the `google-genai` SDK with `tenacity` retries. Requires `GEMINI_API_KEY`. |

Switch providers via `EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=mlx|gemini` in `.env`. The
factory runs a `health_check()` and falls back to the alternate provider
if the primary is unavailable. Mismatched vector sizes between providers
mean swapping the active provider implies re-creating the Qdrant
collection - acceptable as a one-time migration cost for a single-user
deploy.

```bash
# Encode a probe and print a vector preview.
uv run sdet-brain-embed encode "Hello SDET Brain"

# Inspect which provider answered, including any fallback chain.
uv run sdet-brain-embed health
```

## Running the server

Three transports cover the realistic deployment surfaces:

```bash
# 1. REST + MCP-over-HTTP (default - serves /health, /status,
#    /search, /ingest, /docs, /openapi.json, plus /mcp for MCP-HTTP).
uv run sdet-brain-server

# 2. MCP over stdio (the transport Claude Desktop uses).
uv run sdet-brain-mcp-stdio

# 3. MCP over Server-Sent Events (long-lived connection for remote
#    Claude Code or OpenCode clients; defaults to port 8081).
uv run sdet-brain-mcp-sse
```

### Claude Desktop integration

Claude Desktop **does not natively support** the HTTP transport in
`mcpServers`. You need a stdio bridge - the `mcp-remote` npm package
forwards stdio calls to the streamable-HTTP server running on
`localhost:8080`.

**Working config** (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sdet-brain": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "http://localhost:8080/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

After saving, **Cmd+Q** Claude Desktop (full quit, not just closing
the window), then relaunch and verify `sdet-brain` shows up in the
MCP tools list.

If you'd rather skip the bridge entirely, point Claude Desktop straight
at the stdio entrypoint installed by `uv sync`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sdet-brain": {
      "command": "/Users/<you>/dev/darco81/sdet-brain/.venv/bin/sdet-brain-mcp-stdio"
    }
  }
}
```

**Claude Code (CLI) uses a different format** - native HTTP transport
works directly there:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sdet-brain": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://localhost:8080/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

## MCP tools

The MCP server exposes five tools - one liveness probe and the four
core capabilities.

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `ping` | Cheap liveness probe; returns `{status, service}`. |
| `search(query, limit=5, source_type?, min_score=0.0)` | Semantic search with an optional source-type filter and a minimum cosine-similarity threshold. Returns Markdown-formatted hits with score, heading path, and chunk text. |
| `ingest_path(path, force=false)` | Run the ingestion pipeline against a file or directory. Honours the content-hash cache unless `force` is set. Returns the same `IngestStats` summary as the CLI. |
| `list_sources(source_type?)` | Group every indexed chunk by source path. Filter by source type to scope the listing. |
| `get_chunk_neighbors(source_path, chunk_index, window=2)` | Pull the chunks surrounding a hit (clamped to file bounds). Useful when a search result needs more context. |

Tool descriptions visible to Claude include "use when" / "don't use
when" hints to keep call patterns predictable. Inspect with
`npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uv run sdet-brain-mcp-stdio`.

## How to ingest your corpus

The pipeline walks Markdown files, parses frontmatter, chunks them
semantically, embeds the chunks, and upserts them into Qdrant. Re-runs
are idempotent: files whose `content_hash` has not changed are
skipped.

```bash
# 1. Make sure Qdrant is running and the collection exists.
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d qdrant
uv run sdet-brain-qdrant init

# 2. Ingest a directory (or a single file).
uv run sdet-brain-ingest /Users/you/notes
uv run sdet-brain-ingest /Users/you/notes/single-file.md

# 3. Re-running shows the cache hit.
uv run sdet-brain-ingest /Users/you/notes
# -> "skipped N files (cache)"

# 4. Force a re-embed (e.g. after switching embedding providers).
uv run sdet-brain-ingest /Users/you/notes --force
```

Source-type tagging is path-driven: files inside the brand drafts,
articles, sprint-reports, or project-knowledge directories pick up the
right `source_type` payload automatically. Anything outside lands as
`unknown`.

### Configure your corpus paths

The CLI reads source roots from environment variables (one comma-
separated list per `source_type`). On Dariusz's local box every var is
empty and the CLI falls back to a hard-coded default that points at
his repos. On any other machine - especially the VPS deploy in T3-03
- set the env vars explicitly so files outside Dariusz's home are
classified correctly:

```bash
# .env or shell env
PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_PATHS=/srv/brand/drafts
DRAFTS_PATHS=/srv/brand/drafts
ARTICLES_PATHS=/srv/brand/articles
SPRINT_REPORTS_PATHS=/srv/brand/sprint-reports/toolkit,/srv/brand/sprint-reports/pro
BRIEF_PATHS=/srv/brand/brief
```

Each var accepts a comma-separated list. Empty means "fall back to
the local default". The watcher (`sdet-brain-watcher`) reads the
same vars so a single `.env` controls both ingestion modes.

## Live sync mode (file watcher)

Run the watcher daemon to keep the brain in step with on-disk edits.
A 300 ms debounce window collapses VS Code's burst of save events into
a single re-ingest; deletes are propagated as `delete_by_filter`
calls so removed files vanish from the index.

```bash
# Foreground - tail the logs to see "Re-ingested ... (N chunks ...)".
WATCH_PATHS=/Users/you/notes,/Users/you/drafts uv run sdet-brain-watcher

# Or: run the watcher container alongside Qdrant.
SDET_BRAIN_CORPUS_HOST=/Users/you/notes \
  docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml --profile watcher up -d
```

`SIGINT` / `SIGTERM` triggers a graceful shutdown that drains any
pending debounced events. Hidden files, `node_modules`, and anything
that isn't `.md` are filtered automatically.

## Project status

This repo is at the **bootstrap** milestone (`v0.1.0`). The skeleton, tooling,
and Docker scaffolding are in place - everything else is sequenced as Linear
issues `SDE-18` through `SDE-36` (Tiers 1 / 2 / 3).

| Tier | Goal | Tracked in |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 (`v0.1.0`) | MVP - local Qdrant, ingestion pipeline, MCP server, 4 core tools | SDE-18..SDE-27 |
| 2 (`v0.2.0`) | Domain tools, hybrid search, reranking, local LLM | SDE-28..SDE-32 |
| 3 (`v0.3.0`) | Conversational chat, eval suite, VPS deploy with HMAC auth | SDE-33..SDE-36 |

See [`docs/sprints/`](docs/sprints/) for per-task sprint reports.

## Development workflow

uv run ruff check src tests       # lint
uv run mypy --strict src          # type check
uv run pytest -v                  # tests
```

Conventional commits, atomic per Linear issue. Branches are not pushed
automatically - the maintainer reviews each commit before pushing to GitHub.
